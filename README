== DESCRIPTION:

This bunch of scripts are for analizing emails from Nagios.
While letters comes, the scripts will store events in spool
directory and notify you using popup messages and statusbar.

== SCRIPTS:

* parser.pl:
 Is for reading and parsing emails from Nagios.
 Call it from procmail or similar and it will save new event 
 in the spool directory, then notify your using notify.pl
 script.

* notify.pl:
 Shows red/green/yellow popup when new event come. Is called 
 by parser.pl.
 
* daemon.pl:
 Scans spool and shows current events using permanent dzen2 
 statusbar or just write it to run/status file.

* get_status.pl
 Just scans spool directory and returns formated status if there
 are events and empty string otherwise

== REQUIRMENTS: 

* perl and nonstandart perl modules:
	* GetOpt::Long
	* Linux::Inotify2
	* Config::Auto
* dzen2

== INSTALL:

=== Base installation:

1. Copy this tree to .dzen2/nagios. If you decide to 
use another dir, than do not forget to pass --base
param to every script.

2. Copy config.example to config. Edit it if you want.

You can check is all setted up correctly by running:
 
 cat test/h-down.msg | ./parser.pl
 and after a while
 cat test/h-up.msg | ./parser.pl

You should see red and green popups and in directory spool
a file should be created and removed.

=== Integrate it with your mail reader:

Ex. for procmail: 
	:0:
	* ^From:.nagios@example.com
	{
		# Firstly copy to .Nagios/ maildir (or mailbox)
		:0 c
		$MAILDIR/.Nagios/
			
		# Then pipe to script:
		:0
		| $HOME/.dzen2/nagios/parse.pl
	}


=== Integrate it with dzen2: 

There is three ways to do this: 

I. daemon.pl with standalone dzen2 statusbar (if you haven't
your own dzen2 statusbar) 

Edit section [daemon] in config and run daemon.pl 
at session startup

II. daemon.pl without own statusbar. 

Run daemon.pl --dump at session startup, then
read ~/.dzen2/nagios/run/status in your statusbar script.

III. run get_status.pl in your statusbar script. 

It's simple but more expensive way, because it does not use 
inotify and polls spool dir every time.
